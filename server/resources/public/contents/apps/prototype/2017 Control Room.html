<h1>Control Room</h1>

<p><em>3D,C,Coding</em></p>

<p>For a company hackathon I came up with a 3D web conferencing idea, I really wanted to feel like I&rsquo;m inside of a control room and everything and everyone is around me. So I wrote a prototype with C and OpenGL that can use an arbitrary number of pre-recorded videos to demonstrate the idea. Altough I didn&rsquo;t win :(, you can try it here, now, in the browser. Listen to the videos carefully and use the arrow keys to navigate.</p>
