<p><strong>&hellip;And Battery Life Enhancer</strong></p>

<p>Fixes sound quality drops when using AirPods with Macs.
It forces the default audio input to be the built-in microphone instead of AirPods' microphone so MacOS doesn&rsquo;t have to mix down the output.
It also increases battery life because AirPods doesn&rsquo;t have to broadcast sound back.
If you have more input devices you can select which device you want to force over the AirPods microphone.</p>

<p>The app runs in the menu bar.</p>
