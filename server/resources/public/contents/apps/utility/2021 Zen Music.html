<p>Zen Music is a music player, visualizer and organizer inspired by the 2000&rsquo;s era iTunes and the tracker music players of the early 90&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Features</p>

<ul>
<li>retro-minimalistic UI</li>
<li>beautiful and smooth UX experience</li>
<li>always-on frequency and scope analyzer visualizers</li>
<li>library auto-organization ( if enabled )</li>
<li>activity window and human-readable database for transparent operation</li>
</ul>


<p>I wrote a music player/visualizer/organizer on FreeBSD, for FreeBSD ( it compiles on Linux also ) because I really missed iTunes after switching to FreeBSD from MacOS and I also really missed the per-channel frequency analyzers of the late 80&rsquo;s/early 90&rsquo;s tracker music players. And because KDE/Qt/GTK couldn&rsquo;t deliver the smoothness/detail I wanted I wrote a separate UI renderer for it. It is still in beta but it&rsquo;s usable now, give it a try if you are into these kind of music players.</p>
