<p>Forwards media keys to iTunes or Spotify directly.</p>

<p>You can prioritize which app you would like to control or you can go with the default behaviour which controls the running app. The app runs in the menu bar.</p>

<p><em>Installation</em></p>

<p><em>Issues you should know about</em></p>

<p>The app listens on the event tap for key events. This causes problems in some rare cases, like</p>

<ul>
<li><p>when changing search engine in Safari&rsquo;s preferences window</p></li>
<li><p>when trying to allow third-party kernel extensions</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In these cases simply pause Mac Media Key Forwarder from it&rsquo;s menu.</p>

<p><em>I want it now!</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Apple just released High Sierra and it brought good things and annoying things : they changed the behaviour of the media controller keys, they no longer control itunes, they control the video playback in safari. This pissed off a lot of people including me, so I just created a menu bar app to proxy media key events to iTunes/Spotify while Apple fixes this. It doesn&rsquo;t support touchbar yet, only physical buttons.</p>
