<h1>SwayOS</h1>

<p>SwayOS is a productivity-oriented minimalist and super elegant desktop layer over unix-like operating systems that can be installed as a standalone OS also. It is suitable for office, internet, system administration and programming work out of the box.</p>

<p>It can be installed by installer scripts on existing OS'es or from a standalone ISO. The only supported OS currently is Arch Linux but hopefully I will get more and more setup script ports for other distributions and OS'es and I will also create some.</p>
