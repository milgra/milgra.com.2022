<p>Do you have a super silent MacBook and sometimes you have no idea whether it is working or not? Or you just interested what tasks MacOS does in the background? Or you are a developer and you need to see what your application is doing in the background?
Mac Activity Indicator puts an icon in your menubar that switches it&rsquo;s led between green and red when activity happens. If you click on the icon a window appears where you can see the last 100 files touched by the operating system.</p>

<p><em>I want it now!</em></p>

<p>In addition to the Mac Audio Keepalive update I have released a new mac app called MacOS Activity Indicator.</p>

<p>It started with fswatch. It&rsquo;s a super handy command line utility installable with brew ( brew install fswatch ), you simply type &ldquo;fswatch /&rdquo; into the terminal and no file activity remains hidden on your computer. You can see what nasty things MacOS and any other app are doing in the background. I use it to generate header files for my c files automagically no matter where they are.</p>

<p>Then I realized that I can create a menu bar activity indicator for slow and silent machines - like the new MacBook - because sometimes they seem to be unresponsive and you don&rsquo;t know what is happening. As a plus, I&rsquo;ve added an observation window - you can open/close it by clicking on the menu bar icon - that shows the last 100 changed files.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to add no filtering or external app option - it&rsquo;s just a comfy indicator/quick check app - if you want to do serious work then use fswatch instead.</p>

<p>The app is open source in the pulbic domain as always .</p>
