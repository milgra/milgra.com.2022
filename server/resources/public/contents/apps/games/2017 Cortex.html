<p>&ldquo;SO ADDICTING AND AMAZING - Just downloaded the game and started playing and became instantly addicted. A very interesting concept! I highly recommend it especially for only .99 cents&rdquo; 5/5 USA</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like that before. For the price, it&rsquo;s totally worth it! Love the modern-retro atmosphere.&rdquo; 5/5 Hungary</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thoroughly enjoyed the journey through this game and had no qualms with the simplicity of the gameplay, since the difficulty made me push harder and harder each time. Great game, great music (maybe the vocals are a bit much) and overall smooth mechanics that took me for a ride more than once.&rdquo; 5/5 Denmark</p>

Find out who is the real genius among you: the neuro-surgeons talk the talk, but can they handle the Cortex? Just the right amount of subtle but fast-paced taps are needed to guide your precious thought through the brain. Get too excited and splat. Great competition for your friends: apparently for some people it&rsquo;s a breeze, and others (like me) crash into walls a lot. :-) I&rsquo;m getting better though. Can&rsquo;t let the nerds beat me! Good music! Needs instructions: tap sides of screen to shift dot through the maze.</p>

There is no point using words to explain how great this game is, just play it</p>

<p>Instant, miminalistic, strong flow experience

Up front: If you’re looking for a deep plot with characters and the usual game elements this will surprise you. It’s a very simple game, but is incredibly captivating. As you progress through the different levels, you must focus simply on not loosing focus. If you’re into games like Super Hexagon and appreciate minimalistic, finely crafted games, try this out.</p>
