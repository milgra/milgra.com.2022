<p>Mass Point dynamics engine for clojurescript.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing simple mass point dynamics engines since 2001, I&rsquo;ve started with flash Actionscript, then moved to Java, then C and finally here it is in Clojure. It is still in progress, have to fix a few glitches, but works well in my game Brawl.</p>
