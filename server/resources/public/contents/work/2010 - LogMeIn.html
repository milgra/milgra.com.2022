<h1>2010 - 2013, 2015 - 2018 LogMeIn Inc.</h1>

<p>After failing with our own company in 2009 I started working for LogMeIn Inc, a very successful post-startup company. I worked almost on all products, did actionscript, javascript, Objective-C, C, C++, Python, Ruby programming. My favorite part was working on the embedded C clients for microcontrollers for the product called Xively, which is now part of Google&rsquo;s ioT portfolio.</p>
