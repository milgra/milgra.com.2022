<h1>2021 Started working at Flexiana</h1>

<p>Flexiana is a company that gathers Clojure programmers and outsources them to projects and they are becoming the third biggest Clojure programmer employers in the world. A friend of mine invited me to the company and after four rounds of interviews I was hired. This is my current workplace.</p>
