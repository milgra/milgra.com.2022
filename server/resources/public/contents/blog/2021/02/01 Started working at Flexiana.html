<p><em>2021/02/01 clojure</em></p>

<p>Clojure is a fantastic language and it&rsquo;s user base is growing in a healthy state, but there aren&rsquo;t much company yet that uses it exclusively. And there is Flexiana, a company that gathers clojure programmers and outsources them to projects and they are becoming the third biggest clojure programmer employers in the world. A friend of mine invited me to the company and after four rounds of interview I was there.</p>

<p>And I love it! It is a remote only company with great staff, I got outsourced to a german company with my friend, working in clojure with smart people is super.</p>
