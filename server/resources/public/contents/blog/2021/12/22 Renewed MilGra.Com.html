<p>New year, new homepage!</p>

<p>My last homepage was based on clojurescript on the client side and clojure/datomic on the server side. It was okay because I wanted to learn those technologies. But now I wanted to return to minimalism.
First of all I don&rsquo;t like migrating data from old databases to new, upgrading databases and I don&rsquo;t like if I cannot access my blog entries simply on the file system. I want to be able to &ldquo;touch&rdquo; and &ldquo;backup&rdquo; them easily. So this year I returned to file based storage. I store my entries in markdown in a year/month directory structure and I generate html versions of them in case of modification. I also store comments in files and the best thing that this content is quite static so I can cache it and it will be faster than any database. The other awesome thing is searching in files : I can use the command line tools find and grep and they return the wanted files immediately.</p>

<p>The server-side is still clojure/compojure but it&rsquo;s quite simple, around 60 lines currently.</p>

<p>And on the frontend I fed up with 6 Megabyte big lib-heavy transcompiled javascript blobs so I decided to go with pure javascript. The other thing I wanted to achieve is an infinite-scrolling list view that loads items on demand and removes and frees items when they roll offscreen, so memory footprint and dom elements remain minimal and I get a responsive homepage. I also wanted this list to be able to expand items and show my entries in place. The design is also responsive since I wanted to use my infinite-scroller list to show my guitar tabs for me on mobile when doing campfire playing.</p>

<p>The so-called zenlist component is around 450 lines, the main logic is around 400 lines of code, the page and scrolling is fast and light, I&rsquo;m satisfied!</p>
