<h1>i3-overview is ready!</h1>

<p><em>2021/12/04 C,linux</em></p>

<p>i3-overview is an application that shows thumbnails for all workspaces to make navigation in i3 easier.</p>

<p>Features</p>

<ul>
<li>no downscaled and confusing thumbnails, just crystal clear app names and titles</li>
<li>layout schema makes workspace identification easier</li>
<li>super lightweight, 0% cpu and memory usage when idle</li>
</ul>


<p>Sometimes when I have to open an extreme amount of windows in i3 I really miss macos&rsquo;s expose function. So I decided to create someting similar but simple and minimalistic that fits i3&rsquo;s philospohy. It draws a schema based on i3-msg&rsquo;s get_tree output, it opens an X window and puts the image there.</p>
