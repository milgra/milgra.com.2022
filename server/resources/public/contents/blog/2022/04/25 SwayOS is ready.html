<h1>SwayOS is ready!</h1>

<p><em>2022/04/25 C,linux</em></p>

<p>I think that sway is the future of linux desktop and I want to push it to everyone possible. So I&rsquo;ve created a desktop configuration for sway that is suitable for beginners, user friendly, super elegant but still as minimal as possible.</p>

<p>It can be installed by installer scripts on existing OS'es or from a standalone ISO. The only supported OS currently is Arch Linux but hopefully I will get more and more setup script ports for other distributions and OS'es and I will also create some.</p>
