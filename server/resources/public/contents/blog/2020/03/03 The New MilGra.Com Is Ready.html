<h1>The new milgra.com is ready</h1>

<p><em>2020/03/03 Clojure,Datomic</em></p>

<p>After four weeks of development ( 2 weeks learning datomic/css/compojure/reagent and setting up a basic project, 2 weeks finishing/refining ) my new site is ready, it was a pleasant ride!</p>

<p>For 15 years I tried to stay away from web development because of javascript, html, css, the 3-4 different browser standards, but now a lot of thing is different : there&rsquo;s only one browser now ( chrome ), with clojure/clojurescript html/javascript can be totally avoided and picking up css needed just a small amount of energy.</p>

<p>Clojure lived up to its fame : the code is super compact and it will be much smaller if I wire out the remaining css parts, server side code is even smaller, inline evaluation makes both server and client side development a breeze and datomic is fantastic.</p>
