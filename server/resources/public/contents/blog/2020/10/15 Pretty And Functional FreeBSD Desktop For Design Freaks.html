<h1>Pretty And Functional FreeBSD Desktop For Design Freaks</h1>

<p><em>2020/10/15 FreeBSD,Unix</em></p>

<p>After one year of Linux I switched to FreeBSD. I wanted to do that right after MacOS but wifi and GPU drivers were missing from FreeBSD for my Lenovo Legion but the 13.0 CURRENT branch of FreeBSD finally has them so I could move to FreeBSD.</p>

<p>It is such a breeze! Moving from Linux to FreeBSD is like moving to a well designed, clean house from a dog house. Everything is thought-out, command line tools are awesomely logical, documentation is awesome, full source and ports collection can be installed with the system so you have all the source files of the open source world in addition to the kernel/userland program&rsquo;s source. I hope that FreeBSD will catch up with laptop drivers and become a real alternative to out-of-the-box linux desktop systems.</p>
