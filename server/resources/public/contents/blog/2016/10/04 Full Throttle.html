<h1>Full Throttle</h1>

<p><em>2016/10/04 Bikes</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been learning to wheelie for 6 months now. I always wanted to do it but never took it too seriously before.</p>

<p>I started with my bicycle. It&rsquo;s a nice trek 7.3 with a massive frame, very easy to pull up the front in the first gear. After a few weeks I could do 4-5 meters so it felt the right time to switch to the motorbike.</p>

<p>I have a quite used KTM 640 LC4 used by an experienced supermoto biker before.</p>

<p>I bought it in this state on purpose because I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to hurt my previous shiny DRZ 400. Having it for two years now I have to say it is far superior to the DRZ in every aspect IMHO.</p>

<p>I watched a few videos on youtube about wheelieing and decided to start practicing on an uphill.</p>

<p>The best uphill around Szeged with a decent surface is in the Oil Fields of Algyő, Hungary&rsquo;s biggest and only oil field with a lot of service roads, it&rsquo;s a paradise for cyclist and bikers in the summer. There are a few overpasses over the M40 highway, the one with the less traffic is the closest one to the Tisza Bridge.</p>

<p>So I started there in May. It is super frightening. Your body is prepared to fall back and jump off and it&rsquo;s pretty hard at the beginning to force your hands to throw the clutch out. ( after a few near-fallback experiences ).</p>

<p>I pulled too small throttle at the beginning and the engine always stopped. Then I pulled too much and had to jump off the bike. Surprisingly the motorbike never fell over, I could always keep it standing ( I have quite long hands ) but it stayed standing on it&rsquo;s tail a lot of times ( thanks to the genius of the KTM frame engineers, they prepared the bike for clowns like me :) ). The rear lamp immediately broke off and also the frame for the license plate.</p>

<p>After a month and hitting the first wheel a lot of times to the road ( which kills the wheel and the steering bearing quite quickly ) I realized that I have to use much more throttle and I have to fine tune the whole process with the clutch so I can control the wheel height much easier.</p>

<p>So from month to month pulling up the first wheel became more and more controlled. The first milestone came after three months. I was still in the same fear every time I started to practice and I got fed up with it, I decided to force calmness to myself, don&rsquo;t think about anything and to stay in the moment. And it worked. I could do 4-5 meters in balance position and I realized what did I do wrong before : my head was moving together with the bike, I was staring at the handlebars and didn&rsquo;t have a fix balancing point. The solution is to watch the horizon all the time so the head stays in a fix horizontal position and your balancing improves big time.</p>

<p>After I carved the horizon staring in my brain things went much-much smoother, after a month I mastered the clutch and gas handling, I could pull up the wheel in any height I wanted. But I couldn&rsquo;t go more than 4-5 meters, so the balancing/balance position is the next step.</p>

<p>The next milestone came last weekend when I felt that I can finally put my legs up on the footpegs and keep the right on the brakes for safety, because in the previous five months I did it with the legs down on the road and helping balancing by pushing up myself and the bike with me. It went quite easy, it wasn&rsquo;t frightening any more, from the previous experiences I could handle the balance point quite well and emergency braking with the right leg works quite well. But the wheeling distance was the same, I couldn&rsquo;t keep the balance point. And then I calmed myself again, stayed in the moment and realized that while I&rsquo;m looking at the horizon I can improve balancing by pushing my upper body closer to and farther from the steering bars so I can keep the bike vertical much longer. Sometimes I do 8-10 meters with this technique, it&rsquo;s very exciting.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s where I am now and I won&rsquo;t leave the path to a succesful infinite wheelie! :)</p>
