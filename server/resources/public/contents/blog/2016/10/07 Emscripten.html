<p>Emscripten compiles C code to javascript. Not any kind of C code, just carefully, platform-independently written C code. Not to plain javascript, but to superfast asm.js javascript. It converts OpenGL3/ES2 calls to WebGL calls, it converts BSD sockets to Websockets, it puts MEMFS/IDBFS file systems under your file I/O and you don&rsquo;t have to deal with anything! ( Okay, you can&rsquo;t use POSIX threads but if you really need them you can work it around with webworkers ).</p>

<p>So you just take previously written C/OPENGL games/prototypes and you compile them for the BROWSER!!! It&rsquo;s madness!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have the nerve for web programming, for tons of DOM elements and css, for different js vm implementations, for debugging hell and everything else modern web &ldquo;gave&rdquo; me as a developer. And now I don&rsquo;t have to deal with all these things, and still I can deploy for the browser!!! ( okay, I have to deal with them a little because it still is web development, but hey, I only need hours now to fix something strange, not days!!! )</p>

<p>I already compiled a lot of my stuff to javascript with this fantastic technology :</p>

<p>The ultimate fighting experience, <a href="/downloads/brawl/index.html">Mass Brawl</a><br/>
The ambient-reflex game, <a href="/downloads/cortex/index.html">Cortex</a><br/>
The conference prototype, <a href="/downloads/controlroom/index.html">Control Room</a><br/>
Laser trinagulation prototype, <a href="/downloads/laserscan/index.html">Laserscan</a></p>

<p>IMHO Emscripten is the best technology of the 2010&rsquo;s so far.</p>
