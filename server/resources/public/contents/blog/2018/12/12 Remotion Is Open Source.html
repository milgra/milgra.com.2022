<h1>Remotion Is Open Source</h1>

<p><em>2018/12/12 C,Coding</em></p>

<p>One of my earlier projects with a moderate success was to make a wiimote out of an iphone wiht the help of the accelerometers. I created an iphone app and a small macos host application, they find each other via bonjour, and the host injects the motion information as mouse coordinates. It&rsquo;s six years old, might not compile on newer macos'es.</p>
