<h1>PreziThreeD Is Open Source</h1>

<p><em>2018/12/14 C,Coding</em></p>

<p>I was always curious why prezi didn&rsquo;t create a 3D version out of their app. It turned out that they experimented with it and dropped it in the end. So I created my own version and I really like how it looks like, how &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; can improve the mood of the presentation. But it complicates presentation creation big time for sure.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created a demo presentation about my life! :)</p>
