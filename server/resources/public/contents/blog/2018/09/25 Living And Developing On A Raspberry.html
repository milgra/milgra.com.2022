<h1>Living and Developing on a Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>My new game will run on all platforms possible but the first supported platform will be the Raspberry Pi because of 80&rsquo;s nostalgia. I love the fact that there is a super cheap home computer again that ages well - they don&rsquo;t double the cpu speed every year, they still sell the first version so you can optimise for the hardware and you also have to because it&rsquo;s not that strong - and I love this fact.</p>

<p>For a week I used my Raspberry Pi 3 as my main computer. And it was surprisingly usable, it is like a machine from the early 2000&rsquo;s. Overall desktop experience is okay, the terminal and file manager works well, LibreOffice and normal applications run fast enough, I used Code::Blocks for programming, the current raspbian apt version ( 16.04 ) is terribly buggy, I had to compile the latest one ( 17.12 ) on the raspberry which needed a few hours but it worked flawlessly after. Chromium, the now-default browser is the weakest point, it is a monstrous software and it had to run modern javascript which is also a monstrous task. Javascript intensive pages ( facebook and modern &ldquo;portals&rdquo; ) kill the board in two tabs, youtube can be in 6-7 tabs and it handles simple sites well. But it is advised to use only 1-2 tabs whatever you do.</p>

<p>Since my game doesn&rsquo;t use any framework and it&rsquo;s quite simple the board compiled it in a few seconds so development was rapid.</p>

<p>To summarise my experience : modern web is not for the raspberry pi but it is good for everything else, it is a super cheap and capable home computer.</p>
