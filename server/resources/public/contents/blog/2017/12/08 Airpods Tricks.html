<h1>Airpods Tricks</h1>

<p><em>2017/12/08 Apple,Mac</em></p>

<p>As soon as Airpods entered the market back in 2016 November I ordered one because I really needed reliable wireless earphones for running after a year with a terrible JBL. And it lived up to the expectations, I never heard any cracking sound or breaking music during running any more which is super cool. But controls were a little bit limited - bringing up siri with a double tap was totally useless for me and I never checked Airpods settings for more options because I&rsquo;m lazy. How wrong was I!</p>

<p>It turned out that you can set up double tap functions for both sides individually.</p>

<p>Left double tap became play/pause, right double tap became next song - and there, I can do more with the airpods than with the earpods - besides volume control. I really miss volume control, but sound check in the Music app/iTunes helps in this problem a lot.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m super satisfied with the Airpods, it&rsquo;s Apple&rsquo;s best new product in years. Even with the constant putting up/taking down of the <a href="https://earhoox.com">earhoox</a> beacuse of my monkey ears.</p>
