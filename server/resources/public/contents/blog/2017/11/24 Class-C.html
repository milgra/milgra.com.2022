<h1>Class-C</h1>

<p><em>2017/11/24 C,Coding</em></p>

<p>There was a time when I thought that object-orientation is the cure for all diseases and everything should be object-oriented. I already felt that C++ is way too over-engineered and Java is not low-level enough for me so I came up with my own object-oriented C version. After I finished and wrote a few programs/games in it I realized that the problem for me is not the language, it&rsquo;s the object-orientation. It should be used only in special cases not all the time. Functional programming is better, but keeping the code minimalistic aaand readable at the same time is the best, no matter what paradigm you use. So I stucked with C.</p>
