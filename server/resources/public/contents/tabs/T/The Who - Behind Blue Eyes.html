<p>Em No one knows what it&rsquo;s G like, to be the D bad man   <br/>
To be the C sad man, A behind blue eyes   <br/>
Em No one knows what it&rsquo;s G like to be D hated   <br/>
To be C fated, to telling A only lies</p>

<p>But my C dreams, D they aren&rsquo;t as G empty   <br/>
As my C conscience D seems to E be   <br/>
I have Bm7 hours, only C lonely   <br/>
My love is D vengeance that&rsquo;s never A free</p>

<p>Em No one knows what it&rsquo;s G like to feel these D feelings   <br/>
C Like I do, and I A blame you   <br/>
Em No one bites back as G hard on their D anger   <br/>
C None of my pain and woe, A can show through</p>

<p>C But my dreams, D they aren&rsquo;t as G empty   <br/>
C As my conscience D seems to E be   <br/>
I have Bm7 hours, C only lonely   <br/>
D My love is vengeance A that&rsquo;s never free</p>

<p>Em No one knows what its G like   <br/>
D To be mistreated, C to be defeated   <br/>
A Behind blue eyes   <br/>
Em No one knows how to G say   <br/>
D That they&rsquo;re sorry and C don&rsquo;t worry   <br/>
A I&rsquo;m not telling lies</p>

<p>C But my dreams, D they aren&rsquo;t as G empty   <br/>
C As my conscience D seems to E be   <br/>
Dm I have hours, C only lonely   <br/>
D My love is vengeance A that&rsquo;s never free</p>

<p>Em No one knows what it&rsquo;s G like, to be the D bad man   <br/>
C To be the sad man, A behind blue eyes</p>
