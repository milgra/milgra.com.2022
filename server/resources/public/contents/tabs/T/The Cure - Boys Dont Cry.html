(A)A Bm I would say I&rsquo;m sorry  <br/>
C#m D  <br/>
  If I thought that it would change your mind <br/>

 But I know that this time <br/>
C#m D  <br/>
 I have said too much, been too unkind <br/>
Refrain:  <br/>

I would break down at your feet  <br/>
C#m D  <br/>
 And beg forgiveness plead with you <br/>
A Bm  <br/>
 But I know that it&rsquo;s too late <br/>
C#m D  <br/>
 And now there&rsquo;s nothing I can do <br/>
