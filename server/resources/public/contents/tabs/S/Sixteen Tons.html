<p>Am Am/GF E Some people say a man is made outa mud  <br/>
  Am         Am/G      F         E <br/>
A poor man&rsquo;s made outa muscle &lsquo;n blood <br/>
Am         Am/G      Dm <br/>
Muscle an&rsquo; blood an' skin an' bone <br/>
  Am                     E <br/>
A mind that&rsquo;s weak and a back that&rsquo;s strong <br/>
Chorus  <br/>
         Am      Am/G     F          E <br/>
You load sixteen tons an' what do ya get <br/>
 Am         Am/G      F         E <br/>
Another day older an' deeper in debt <br/>
      Am              Am/G           Dm <br/>
Saint Peter don&rsquo;t cha call me &lsquo;cause I can&rsquo;t go <br/>
Am EAm <br/>
I owe my soul to the company store  <br/>
I was born one mornin&rsquo; when the sun didn&rsquo;t shine <br/>
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine <br/>
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal <br/>
And the strawboss said well bless my soul <br/>
Chorus:  <br/>
I was born one morning in the drizzlin' rain <br/>
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name <br/>
I was raised in the canebreak by an' ol' mama lion <br/>
Ain&rsquo;t no high-tone woman make me walk the line <br/>
Chorus:  <br/>
If ya see me comin' better step aside <br/>
A lotta men din&rsquo;t an' a lotta men died <br/>
With one fist of iron an' the other of steel <br/>
If the right one don' getcha then the left one will <br/>
Chorus:</p>
