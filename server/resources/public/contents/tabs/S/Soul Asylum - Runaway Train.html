<p>Intro: C  <br/>
C  <br/>
          Call you up in the middle of the night <br/>
Em/B  <br/>
          Like a firefly without a light <br/>
Am  <br/>
          You were there like a blowtorch burnin' <br/>
G  <br/>
          I was a key that could use a little turnin' <br/>
C  <br/>
          So tired that I couldn&rsquo;t even sleep <br/>
Em  <br/>
So many secrets I couldn&rsquo;t keep <br/>
Am  <br/>
Promised myself I wouldn&rsquo;t weep <br/>
G  <br/>
One more promise I couldn&rsquo;t keep <br/>
FG  <br/>
It seems no one can help me now <br/>
C Am  <br/>
I&rsquo;m in too deep there&rsquo;s no way out <br/>
F Em G  <br/>
This time I have really led myself astray <br/>
Chorus:  <br/>
C  <br/>
Runaway train never going back <br/>
Em  <br/>
Wrong way on a one way track <br/>
Am  <br/>
Seems like I should be getting somewhere <br/>
G  <br/>
Somehow I&rsquo;m neither here nor there <br/>
Verse 2:  <br/>
C  <br/>
Can you help me remember how to smile <br/>
Em  <br/>
Make it somehow all seem worthwile <br/>
Am  <br/>
How on earth did I get so jaded <br/>
G  <br/>
Life&rsquo;s mysteries seem so faded <br/>
C  <br/>
I can go where no one else can go <br/>
Em  <br/>
I know what no one else knows <br/>
Am  <br/>
Here I am just drowning in the rain <br/>
G  <br/>
With a ticket for a runaway train <br/>
FG  <br/>
And everything seems cut and dry <br/>
C Am  <br/>
Day and night, Earth and sky <br/>
FEm G  <br/>
Somehow I just don&rsquo;t believe it <br/>
Chorus:  <br/>
C  <br/>
Repeat  <br/>
Runaway train never going back <br/>
Em  <br/>
Wrong way on a one way track <br/>
Am  <br/>
Seems like I should be getting somewhere <br/>
G  <br/>
Somehow I&rsquo;m neither here nor there <br/>
Bridge:  <br/>
C  <br/>
Got a ticket for a runaway train <br/>
Em  <br/>
Like a madman laughing at the rain <br/>
Am  <br/>
Little out of touch little insane <br/>
G  <br/>
It&rsquo;s just easier than dealing with the pain <br/>
C  <br/>
Runaway train never going back <br/>
Em  <br/>
Wrong way on a one way track <br/>
Am  <br/>
Seems like I should be getting somewhere <br/>
G  <br/>
Somehow I&rsquo;m neither here nor there <br/>
C  <br/>
Runaway train never coming back <br/>
Em  <br/>
Runaway train tearing up the track <br/>
Am  <br/>
Runaway train burning in my veins <br/>
G  <br/>
Id runaway but it always seems the same. <br/>
C-Em-Am-G  and fade</p>
