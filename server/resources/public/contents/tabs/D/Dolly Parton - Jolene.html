<p>Am Jolene, C Jolene, G Jolene, Jo Am lene <br/>
I<code>m G  begging of you please dont take my Am man   
Am Jolene, C Jolene, G Jolene, Jo Am lene   
G Please don</code>t take him just because you Am can</p>

<p>Your Am beauty is C beyond compare <br/>
With G flaming locks of Am auburn hair <br/>
With G ivory skin and eyes of emerald Am green <br/>
Your Am smile is like a C breath of spring <br/>
Your G voice is soft like Am summer rain <br/>
And I G cannot compete with you, Am Jolene</p>

<p>He Am talks about you C in his sleep <br/>
Theres G nothing I can do Am to keep <br/>
From G crying when he calls your name, Am Jolene <br/>
And Am I can easily  C understand  <br/>
How G you could easily Am take my man <br/>
But G you don`t know what he means to me, Am Jolene</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Am You could have your C choice of men <br/>
But G I could never Am love again <br/>
He`s the G only one for me, Am Jolene <br/>
I Am had to have this C talk with you  <br/>
My G happiness de Am pends on you <br/>
And G whatever you decide to do, Am Jolene</p>

<p>Chorus</p>
