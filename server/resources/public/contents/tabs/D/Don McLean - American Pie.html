<p>  G     D/F#    Em7 <br/>
A long, long time ago <br/>
Am            C                  Em                  D <br/>
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile <br/>
    G      D/F#   Em7 <br/>
And I knew if I had my chance <br/>
     Am                 C                Em              C            D <br/>
That I could make those people dance and maybe they&rsquo;d be happy for a while <br/>
    Em       Am              Em                 Am <br/>
But February made me shiver, with every paper I&rsquo;d deliver <br/>
C        G/B    Am             C                     D <br/>
Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn&rsquo;t take one more step <br/>
  G          D/F#     Em           Am7            D <br/>
I can&rsquo;t remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride <br/>
G         D/F#       Em <br/>
Something touched me deep inside <br/>
    C      D7      G <br/>
The day the music died</p>

<p>[Chorus] <br/>
   G    C        G        D <br/>
So bye, bye Miss American Pie <br/>
         G            C            G        D <br/>
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry <br/>
         G        C                  G           D <br/>
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye <br/>
        Em<em>                         A7</em>   Em*                         D7 <br/>
Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die</p>

<p>[Verse 2] <br/>
G                 Am <br/>
Did you write the book of love <br/>
       C                 Am         Em           D <br/>
And do you have faith in God above, if the bible tells you so? <br/>
G      D/F#        Em <br/>
Do you believe in rock and roll <br/>
    Am7            C              Em                 A7           D <br/>
Can music save your mortal soul and can you teach me how to dance real slow? <br/>
       Em<em>                  D</em>                   Em<em>             D</em> <br/>
Well I know that you&rsquo;re in love with him &lsquo;cuz I saw you dancin&rsquo; in the gym <br/>
    C           G/B      Am           C                    D7 <br/>
You both kicked off your shoes, man I dig those rhythm and blues <br/>
        G      D/F#     Em                   Am                   C <br/>
I was a lonely teenage bronckin' buck with a pink carnation and a pickup truck <br/>
    G     D/F#    Em              C       D7    G  C  G         D <br/>
But I knew I was out of luck the day the music died,  I started singin'</p>

<p>[Chorus] <br/>
G    C        G        D <br/>
Bye, bye Miss American Pie <br/>
         G            C            G        D <br/>
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry <br/>
         G        C                  G           D <br/>

Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die</p>

<p>[Verse 3] <br/>
         G                   Am <br/>
Now for ten years we&rsquo;ve been on our own <br/>
      C                   Am          Em                     D <br/>
and moss grows fat on a rolling stone but that&rsquo;s not how it used to be <br/>
          G     D/F#            Em <br/>
When the jester sang for the king and queen <br/>
     Am7                C                   Em             A7          D <br/>
in a coat he borrowed from James Dean in a voice that came from you and me <br/>
         Em<em>                 D</em>               Em<em>                 D</em> <br/>
Oh, and while the king was looking down, the jester stole his thorny crown <br/>
     C        G/B   A7       C                D7 <br/>
The courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned <br/>
          G         D/F#  Em             Am           C <br/>
And while Lennin read a book on Marx, the quartet practiced in the park <br/>
    G       D/F#   Em               C       D7    G  C  G        D <br/>
And we sang dirges in the dark the day the music died,   we were singin'</p>

<p>[Chorus] <br/>
G    C        G        D <br/>
Bye, bye Miss American Pie <br/>
         G            C            G        D <br/>
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry <br/>
         G        C                  G           D <br/>

Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die</p>

<p>[Verse 4] <br/>
G                   Am <br/>
Helter skelter in a summer swelter <br/>
C                      Am                 Em                     D <br/>
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter, eight miles high and fallin' fast <br/>
      G   D/F#  Em <br/>
It landed foul on the grass <br/>
      Am7                C            Em                             A7     D <br/>
the players tried for a forward pass, with the jester on the sidelines in a cast <br/>
         Em<em>               D</em>                  Em<em>                 D</em> <br/>
Now the half-time air was sweet perfume, while sergeants played a marching tune <br/>
C          G/B      A7      C                  D7 <br/>
We all got up to dance, but we never got the chance <br/>
         G        D/F#     Em             Am                  Cm        C <br/>
&lsquo;Cuz the players tried to take the field, the marching band refused to yield <br/>
G         D/F#      Em               C       D7    G  C  G           D <br/>
Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died,   we started singin&rsquo;</p>

<p>[Chorus] <br/>
G    C        G        D <br/>
Bye, bye Miss American Pie <br/>

<p>[Verse 5] <br/>
     G                Am <br/>
And there we were all in one place <br/>
    C        Am            Em                   D <br/>
a generation lost in space, with no time left to start again <br/>
            G      D/F#   Em               Am7                 C <br/>
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack Flash sat on a candle <br/>
       Em                   A7             D <br/>
stick, &lsquo;cuz fire is the devil&rsquo;s only friend <br/>
     Em<em>              D</em>               Em<em>                    D</em> <br/>
And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage <br/>
   C      G/B    A7         C                  D7 <br/>
No angel born in Hell could break that Satan&rsquo;s spell <br/>
           G            D/F#      Em             Am              C <br/>
And as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite <br/>
      G     D/F#     Em                C       D7    G  C  G       D <br/>
I saw Satan laughing with delight the day the music died,   he was singin&rsquo;</p>

<p>[Chorus] <br/>

Bye, bye Miss American Pie <br/>

<p>[Verse 6] <br/>

I met a girl who sang the blues <br/>

And I asked her for some happy news, but she just smiled and turned away <br/>
  G       D/F#      Em <br/>
I went down to the sacred store <br/>
       Am              C                     Em                 C <br/>
Where I&rsquo;d heard the music years before, but the man there said the music <br/>

wouldn&rsquo;t play <br/>

But in the streets the children screamed, the lovers cried and the poets dreamed <br/>
    C     G/B      Am          C                     D <br/>
But not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken <br/>
        G       D/F#   Em            Am7     C             D7 <br/>
And the three men I admire most, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost <br/>
G             D/F#          Em               C       D7    G <br/>
They caught the last train for the coast the day the music died,</p>

<p>N.C.</p>

<p>And they were singin'</p>
