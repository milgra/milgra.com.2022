<p>Christine: <br/>
In sleep he sang to me <br/>
In dreams he came <br/>
That voice which calls to me <br/>
And speaks my name <br/>
And do I dream again <br/>
For now I find <br/>
The Phantom of the Opera is there Inside my mind  <br/>
Phantom:  <br/>
Sing once again with me Our strange duet <br/>
My power over you Grows stronger yet  <br/>
And though you turn from me <br/>
To glance behind <br/>
The Phantom of the Opera is there Inside your mind  <br/>
Christine: <br/>
Those who have seen your face Draw back in fear <br/>
I am the mask you wear  <br/>
Phantom: <br/>
It&rsquo;s me they hear  <br/>
Both: <br/>
My/your spirit and your/my voice In one combined <br/>
The Phantom of the Opera is there Inside your/my mind  <br/>
Offstage: <br/>
He&rsquo;s there the Phantom of the Opera!  <br/>
Phantom: <br/>
In all your fantasies You always knew <br/>
That man and mystery  <br/>
Christine: <br/>
Were both in you  <br/>
Both:  <br/>
And in this labyrinth <br/>
Where night is blind <br/>
The Phantom of the Opera is there Inside your/my mind  <br/>
Christine: <br/>
He&rsquo;s there, the Phantom of the Opera! (Vocalizing)  <br/>
Phantom: <br/>
Sing, my angel of music!  <br/>
Christine: (Vocalizing higher)  <br/>
Phantom: Sing for me!  <br/>
Christine: (Vocalizing higher)  <br/>
Phantom: <br/>
Sing my angel of music!  <br/>
Christine: (Sings higher)  <br/>
Phantom: SING FOR ME!  <br/>
Phantom: <br/>
I have brought you <br/>
To the seat of sweet music&rsquo;s throne <br/>
To this kingdom where all must pay homage to music Music.  <br/>
You have come here <br/>
For one purpose and one alone <br/>
Since the moment I first heard you sing I have needed you with me to serve me To sing for my music</p>
