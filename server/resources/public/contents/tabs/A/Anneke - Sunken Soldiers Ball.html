<p>Bm I can&rsquo;t go home <br/>
A  I cannot sleep <br/>
Bm I cannot give <br/>
A  I cannot keep <br/>
G  This heart of stone has left me here <br/>
With only F#m rumors of your left <br/>
G  I guess to see you leaving was for F#m the best A <br/>
Bm I dream too much <br/>
A  and spend my days <br/>
Bm  Like a sailor G lost at  A sea <br/>
G  And you were like a mermaid <br/>
in that Fm Danish fairytale <br/>
G  I guess the best thing that I could do is to F#m sail A <br/>
Bm Away from this G sunken soldiers ball <br/>
BbmAway, do you G remember me at all? <br/>
Fm I have no better words than G &ldquo;Thank you and goodbye&rdquo; <br/>
Fm I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to see our G love A die Bm</p>

<p>La La La La La</p>

<p>Bm At last I&rsquo;m home <br/>
A  My horse will rest <br/>
Bm This tattoed heart <br/>
A  This trembling chest <br/>
G  must be alone <br/>
And carry this sorrow Fm back to bed <br/>
G  I hope there was no innocent blood F#m shed A <br/>
Bm Away from this G sunken soldiers ball <br/>
Bm Away, do you G remember me at all? <br/>
Fm I have no better words than G &ldquo;Thank you and goodbye&rdquo; <br/>
Fm I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to see our G love A die Bm</p>

<p>La La La La</p>
