<p>Be my guard just for tonight,  <br/>
That is all I m asking for  <br/>
Take me under your wing,  <br/>
I can&rsquo;t make it anymore  <br/>
I am so full of fear,  <br/>
May you read a book to me  <br/>
And when the shadows grow  <br/>
Won t you stay with me</p>

<p>Will you be my guard tonight?  <br/>
That is all I m asking for  <br/>
Will you be my guard tonight?  <br/>
That is all I need to know</p>

<p>Be my guard beside my bed,  <br/>
That is all I need to know  <br/>
Will you please hold my hand,  <br/>
Don&rsquo;t you ever let it go  <br/>
All the wonders of the world  <br/>
For a little second more  <br/>
I can&rsquo;t speak but can&rsquo;t you see,  <br/>
It&rsquo;s your touch I&rsquo;m crying for</p>

<p>Will you be my guard tonight?  <br/>
That is all I m asking for  <br/>
Will you be my guard tonight?  <br/>
That is all I need to know</p>

<p>Be my guard just until dawn,  <br/>
When I can hear the birds again  <br/>
I&rsquo;m as helpless as can be,  <br/>
Will you guard my little flame  <br/>
If we never meet again,  <br/>
You shall always keep in mind  <br/>
That you were my guard tonight,  <br/>
That you were my guard tonight</p>

<p>Will you be my guard tonight?  <br/>
That is all I m asking for  <br/>
Will you be my guard tonight?  <br/>
That is all I need to know</p>
