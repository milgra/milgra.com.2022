<p>There is a house in New Orleans <br/>
They call the Rising Sun <br/>
And it&rsquo;s been the ruin of many a poor boy <br/>
And God I know I&rsquo;m one <br/>
My mother was a tailor <br/>
She sewed my new bluejeans <br/>
My father was a gamblin' man <br/>
Down in New Orleans</p>

<p>Now the only thing a gambler needs <br/>
Is a suitcase and a trunk <br/>
And the only time he&rsquo;s satisfied <br/>
Is when he&rsquo;s on a drunk <br/>
Oh mother tell your children <br/>
Not to do what I have done <br/>
Spend your lives in sin and misery <br/>
In the House of the Rising Sun <br/>
Well, I got one foot on the platform <br/>
The other foot on the train <br/>
I&rsquo;m goin' back to New Orleans <br/>
To wear that ball and chain <br/>
Well, there is a house in New Orleans <br/>
They call the Rising Sun <br/>
And it&rsquo;s been the ruin of many a poor boy <br/>
And God I know I&rsquo;m one</p>
