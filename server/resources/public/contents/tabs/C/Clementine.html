<p>In a cavern, in a canyon, <br/>
    Hm7           D7 <br/>
Excavating for a mine, <br/>
CG Dwelt a miner, forty-niner  <br/>
         Am   -=  D7    G <br/>
And his daughter Clementine. <br/>
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling <br/>
Oh, my darling Clementine! <br/>
You are lost and gone for ever, <br/>
Dreadful sorry, Clementine. <br/>
Light she was and like a fairy, <br/>
And her shoes were number nine, <br/>
Herring boxes without topses, <br/>
Sandals were for Clementine. <br/>
Oh, my darling&hellip; <br/>
Drove she ducklings to the water <br/>
Every morning, just at nine; <br/>
Hit her foot against a splinter, <br/>
Fell into the foaming brine. <br/>
Oh, my darling&hellip; <br/>
Saw her lips above the water <br/>
Blowing bubbles mighty fine <br/>
But alas! I was no swimmer, <br/>
So I lost my Clementine. <br/>
Oh, my darling&hellip; <br/>
In a dream she still does hunt me <br/>
Robed in garments, soaked in brine; <br/>
Tough in life I used to hug her, <br/>
Now she&rsquo;s dead I&rsquo;ll draw the line. <br/>
Oh, my darling&hellip; <br/>
How I missed her, how I missed her, <br/>
How I missed my Clementine! <br/>
But I kissed her little sister <br/>
And forgot my Clementine. <br/>
Oh, my darling&hellip;</p>
