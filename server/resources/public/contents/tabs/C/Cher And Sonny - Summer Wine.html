<p>Am                             G <br/>
 Strawberries, cherries and an angel&rsquo;s kiss in spring. <br/>
Am                         G <br/>
 My summer wine is really made from all these things.</p>

<p>Am                          G <br/>
 I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled too. <br/>
Am                      G <br/>
 A song that I had only sang to just a few. <br/>
Dm                           Am <br/>
 She saw my silver spurs and said let&rsquo;s pass some time. <br/>
Dm                      Am <br/>
 And I will give to you summer wine. <br/>
Dm    G        Am <br/>
Ohhh-oh summer wine.</p>

<p>Am                         G <br/>
 My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak. <br/>
Am                       G <br/>
 I tried to get up but I couldn&rsquo;t find my feet. <br/>
Dm                        Am <br/>

 And then she gave to me more summer wine. <br/>
Dm    G        Am <br/>

 When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes. <br/>

 My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size. <br/>
Dm                           Am <br/>
 She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime. <br/>
