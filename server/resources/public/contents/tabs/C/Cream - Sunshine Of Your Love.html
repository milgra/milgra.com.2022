<p>It&rsquo;s getting near dawn, <br/>
When lights close their tired eyes <br/>
I&rsquo;ll soon be with you my love, <br/>
To give you my dawn surprise</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be with you darling soon, <br/>
I&rsquo;ll be with you when the stars start falling</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting so long <br/>
To be where I&rsquo;m going <br/>
In the sunshine of your love</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m with you my love, <br/>
The light&rsquo;s shining through on you <br/>
Yes, I&rsquo;m with you my love, <br/>
It&rsquo;s the morning and just we two</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll stay with you darling now, <br/>
I&rsquo;ll stay with you till my seas are dried up</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting so long <br/>
To be where I&rsquo;m going <br/>
In the sunshine of your love</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m with you my love, <br/>
The light&rsquo;s shining through on you. <br/>
Yes, I&rsquo;m with you my love, <br/>
It&rsquo;s the morning and just we two. <br/>
I&rsquo;ll stay with you darling now, <br/>
I&rsquo;ll stay with you till my seas are dried up</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting so long <br/>
I&rsquo;ve been waiting so long <br/>
I&rsquo;ve been waiting so long <br/>
To be where I&rsquo;m going <br/>
In the sunshine of your love</p>
