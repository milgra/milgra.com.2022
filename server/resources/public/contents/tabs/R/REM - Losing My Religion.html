G Am  <br/>
   Oh, life is bigger <br/>
Em  <br/>
And you are not me. <br/>
It&rsquo;s bigger than you <br/>
Am  <br/>
The lengths that I will go to, <br/>
Am  <br/>
The distance in your eyes, <br/>
Em Dm  <br/>
   Oh no, I&rsquo;ve said too much, <br/>
G  <br/>
I set it up.  <br/>
That&rsquo;s me in the corner, <br/>
Em  <br/>
That&rsquo;s me in the spotlight <br/>
Am  <br/>
Losing my religion. <br/>
Em  <br/>
Trying to keep up with you. <br/>
Am  <br/>

GAm Em  <br/>
   Every Whisper of every waking hour <br/>
Am  <br/>
I&rsquo;m choosing my confessions, <br/>
Em  <br/>
Trying to keep an eye of you <br/>
Am  <br/>
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool <br/>
Em Dm  <br/>
   Oh no, I&rsquo;ve said too much, <br/>
G  <br/>
I set it up.  <br/>
Am  <br/>
Consider this, consider this, <br/>
Em  <br/>
The hint of a century, <br/>
Am  <br/>
Consider this: the slip <br/>
Em  <br/>
That brought me to my knees failed. <br/>
Am  <br/>
What if all these fantasies <br/>
Em <br/>
Dm G  <br/>
Come <br/>
