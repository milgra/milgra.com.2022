<p>INTRO:EmAmDBm CAmDB  <br/>
EmAm D  <br/>
She never took the train alone <br/>
Bm C  <br/>
she hated being on her own <br/>
Am D  <br/>
She always took me by the hands <br/>
B  <br/>
and say she needs me <br/>
She never wanted love to fail <br/>
she always hoped that it was real <br/>
She&rsquo;d look me in the eyes and say believe me <br/>
And then the night becomes the day <br/>
and there’s nothing left to say <br/>
If there&rsquo;s nothing left to say <br/>
then something’s wrong <br/>
EmAm D Bm  <br/>
Ohhh tonight you killed me with your smile <br/>
C Am B  <br/>
so beautiful and wild so beautiful <br/>
EmAmD Bm  <br/>
Oh tonight you killed me with your smile <br/>
C Am B Em  <br/>
so beautiful and wild so beautiful and wild <br/>
And as the hands would turn with time <br/>
she&rsquo;d always say that she was my mine <br/>
She&rsquo;d turn and lend a smile <br/>
to say that she&rsquo;s gone <br/>
But in a whisper she&rsquo;d arrive <br/>
and dance into my life <br/>
Like a music melody <br/>
like a lovers song <br/>
Oh tonight you killed me with your smile <br/>
so beautiful and wild so beautiful <br/>
Oh tonight you killed me with your smile <br/>
so beautiful and wild so beautiful and wild <br/>
B Em  <br/>
Through the darkest night <br/>
B Em  <br/>
comes the brightest light <br/>
B Em  <br/>
And the light that shines <br/>
Em  <br/>
is deep inside <br/>
B  <br/>
It&rsquo;s who you are <br/>
EmAm D Bm  <br/>
Ohhh tonight you killed me with your smile <br/>
C Am B  <br/>
so beautiful and wild so beautiful <br/>
EmAmD Bm  <br/>
Oh tonight you killed me with your smile <br/>
C Am B Em  <br/>
so beautiful and wild so beautiful and wild <br/>
CAmD C  <br/>
Oh tonight.. you killed me with your smile <br/>
Am DB Em  <br/>
so beautiful and wild so beautiful and wild &hellip;</p>
