<p>Am   C  D  Am   C  D</p>

<p>I hurt myself today to see if I still feel   <br/>
I focus on the pain the only thing that&rsquo;s real   <br/>
The needle tears a hole the old familiar sting   <br/>
Try to kill it all away but I remember G everything</p>

<p>Am What have I F become?  C  My sweetest G friend   <br/>
Am Everyone I F know  goes C away in the G end   <br/>
Am And you could have it F all  G  My empire of G dirt   <br/>
Am I will let you F down  G  I will make you Am hurt</p>

<p>(Am)   C  D  Am    C  D</p>

<p>I wear this crown of thorns   upon my liar&rsquo;s chair   <br/>
Full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair   <br/>
Beneath the stains of time   the feelings disappear   <br/>
You are someone else   I am still right here</p>

<p>Am What have I F become?  C  My sweetest G friend   <br/>
Am Everyone I F know  goes C away in the G end   <br/>
Am And you could have it F all  G  My empire of G dirt   <br/>
Am I will let you F down  G  I will make you Am hurt   <br/>
Am If I could start F again  G a million miles G away   <br/>
Am I would keep F myself  G I would find a way</p>
