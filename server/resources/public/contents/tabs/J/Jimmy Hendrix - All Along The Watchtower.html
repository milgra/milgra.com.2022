<p>There must be some kind of way outta here <br/>
Said the joker to the thief <br/>
There&rsquo;s too much confusion <br/>
I can&rsquo;t get no relief</p>

<p>Business men, they drink my wine <br/>
Plowman dig my earth <br/>
None were level on the mind <br/>
Nobody up at his word <br/>
Hey, hey</p>

<p>No reason to get excited <br/>
The thief he kindly spoke <br/>
There are many here among us <br/>
Who feel that life is but a joke</p>

<p>But, uh, but you and I, we&rsquo;ve been through that <br/>
And this is not our fate <br/>
So let us stop talkin' falsely now <br/>
The hour&rsquo;s getting late, hey</p>

<p>All along the watchtower <br/>
Princes kept the view <br/>
While all the women came and went <br/>
Barefoot servants, too</p>

<p>Outside in the cold distance <br/>
A wildcat did growl <br/>
Two riders were approaching <br/>
And the wind began to howl</p>
