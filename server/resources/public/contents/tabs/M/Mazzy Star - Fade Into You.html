<p>A E Bm  <br/>
I want to hold the hand inside you <br/>
AE Bm  <br/>
I want to take a breath that&rsquo;s true <br/>
A E Bm  <br/>
I look to you and I see nothing <br/>
A E Bm  <br/>
I look to you to see the truth <br/>
A E Bm  <br/>
You live your life You go in shadows <br/>
AE Bm  <br/>
You&rsquo;ll come apart and you&rsquo;ll go black <br/>
AE Bm  <br/>
Some kind of night into your darkness <br/>
AE Bm  <br/>
Colors your eyes with what&rsquo;s not there. <br/>
CHORUS <br/>
AE Bm  <br/>
Fade into you  <br/>
A E Bm  <br/>
Strange you never knew <br/>
AE Bm D  <br/>
Fade into you  <br/>
A E Bm  <br/>
I think it&rsquo;s strange you never knew <br/>
A E Bm  <br/>
A stranger&rsquo;s light comes on slowly <br/>
A stranger&rsquo;s heart without a home <br/>
You put your hands into your head <br/>
And then smiles cover your heart <br/>
CHORUS <br/>
(Repeat 2x) <br/>
Fade into you <br/>
Strange you never knew <br/>
Fade into you <br/>
I think it&rsquo;s strange you never knew <br/>
I think it&rsquo;s strange you never knew (Repeat 2x)</p>
