<p>Am  When you get older, plainer, saner  <br/>
D Em  <br/>

Am  Burning like embers, falling, tender  <br/>
D Longing for the days of no surrender  <br/>
Em Years ago  <br/>
Em And well you know</p>

<p>Am Smoke &lsquo;em if you got them  <br/>
D 'Cause it&rsquo;s going down  <br/>
Em Em7  <br/>
All I ever wanted was you  <br/>
Am I&rsquo;ll never get to heaven  <br/>
D 'Cause I don&rsquo;t know how  <br/>
Em Let&rsquo;s raise a glass or two</p>

<p>Am Wishing I could see the machinations  <br/>
D Em  <br/>
Understand the toil of expectations in your mind  <br/>
Am Hold me like you never lost your patience  <br/>
D Em  <br/>
Tell me that you love me more than hate me all the time  <br/>
Em And you&rsquo;re still mine</p>

<p>Am So smoke &lsquo;em if you&rsquo;ve got 'em  <br/>
D 'Cause it&rsquo;s going down  <br/>
Em All I ever wanted was you  <br/>
C Let&rsquo;s take a drink of heaven  <br/>
D This can turn around  <br/>
