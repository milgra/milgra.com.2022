<p>[Intro] <br/>
C Am C Am</p>

<p>[Verse 1] <br/>
  C                 Am <br/>
I heard there was a secret chord <br/>
     C                   Am <br/>
That David played and it pleased the lord <br/>
    F                G               C        G <br/>
But you don&rsquo;t really care for music, do you? <br/>
        C                  F           G <br/>
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth <br/>
    Am                 F <br/>
The minor fall and the major lift <br/>
    G            E7             Am <br/>
The baffled king composing hallelujah</p>

<p>[Chorus] <br/>
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      Am C Am <br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah &hellip;.</p>

<p>[Verse 2] <br/>
           C                        Am <br/>
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof <br/>
    C               Am <br/>
You saw her bathing on the roof <br/>
    F              G             C            G <br/>
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you <br/>
    C               F       G <br/>
She tied you to her kitchen chair <br/>
    Am                        F <br/>
She broke your throne and she cut your hair <br/>
    G                  E7            Am <br/>
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah</p>

<p>[Chorus] <br/>
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      Am C Am <br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah &hellip;.</p>

<p>[Verse 3] <br/>
C               Am <br/>
Baby, I&rsquo;ve been here before <br/>
     C                       Am <br/>
I&rsquo;ve seen this room and I&rsquo;ve walked this floor <br/>
  F             G             C          G <br/>
I used to live alone before I knew you <br/>
     C                     F      G <br/>
I&rsquo;ve seen your flag on the marble arch <br/>
    Am               F <br/>
But love is not a victory march <br/>
       G               E7          Am <br/>
It&rsquo;s a cold and it&rsquo;s a broken hallelujah</p>

<p>[Chorus] <br/>
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      Am C Am <br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah &hellip;.</p>

<p>[Verse 4] <br/>
            C                   Am <br/>
Well, there was a time when you let me know <br/>
       C            Am <br/>
What&rsquo;s really going on below <br/>
    F             G               C        G <br/>
But now you never show that to me do you <br/>
      C             F        G <br/>
But remember when I moved in you <br/>
        Am            F <br/>
And the holy dove was moving too <br/>
    G               E7            Am <br/>
And every breath we drew was hallelujah</p>

<p>[Chorus] <br/>
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      Am C Am <br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah &hellip;.</p>

<p>[Verse 5] <br/>
      C               Am <br/>
Well, maybe there&rsquo;s a god above <br/>
    C             Am <br/>
But all I&rsquo;ve ever learned from love <br/>
    F                G           C          G <br/>
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you <br/>
     C                  F       G <br/>
It&rsquo;s not a cry that you hear at night <br/>
     Am                 F <br/>
It&rsquo;s not somebody who&rsquo;s seen the light <br/>
       G               E7          Am <br/>
It&rsquo;s a cold and it&rsquo;s a broken hallelujah</p>

<p>[Outro] <br/>
     F           Am          F           C    G   C <br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah &hellip;. <br/>
     F           Am          F           C    G   C <br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah &hellip;. <br/>
     F           Am          F           C    G   C <br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah &hellip;.</p>
