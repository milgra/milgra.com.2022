<p>Em     G         D     Bm <br/>
Alas, my love, you do me wrong, <br/>
   Em          B7 <br/>
To cast me off discourteously. <br/>
    Em     G         D        B <br/>
For I have loved you well and long, <br/>
   Em      B7      Em <br/>
Delighting in your company. <br/>
Chorus: <br/>
GD <br/>
Greensleeves was all my joy <br/>
Em B7 <br/>
Greensleeves was my delight, GD <br/>
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,  <br/>
Em B7E <br/>
And who but my lady greensleeves.  <br/>
Additional Verses: <br/>
Your vows you&rsquo;ve broken, like my heart, <br/>
Oh, why did you so enrapture me? <br/>
Now I remain in a world apart <br/>
But my heart remains in captivity. <br/>
I have been ready at your hand, <br/>
To grant whatever you would crave, <br/>
I have both wagered life and land, <br/>
Your love and good-will for to have. <br/>
If you intend thus to disdain, <br/>
It does the more enrapture me, <br/>
And even so, I still remain <br/>
A lover in captivity. <br/>
My men were clothed all in green, <br/>
And they did ever wait on thee; <br/>
All this was gallant to be seen, <br/>
And yet thou wouldst not love me. <br/>
Thou couldst desire no earthly thing, <br/>
But still thou hadst it readily. <br/>
Thy music still to play and sing; <br/>
And yet thou wouldst not love me. <br/>
Well, I will pray to God on high, <br/>
That thou my constancy mayst see, <br/>
And that yet once before I die, <br/>
Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me. <br/>
Ah, Greensleeves, now farewell, adieu, <br/>
To God I pray to prosper thee, <br/>
For I am still thy lover true, <br/>
Come once again and love me.</p>
