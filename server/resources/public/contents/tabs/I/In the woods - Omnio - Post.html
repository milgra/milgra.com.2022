<p>G#m E C#m D#</p>

<p>G#m These eyes, did I die behind these   <br/>
Cold blue eyes? Did I E know where to go?   <br/>
This G#m light, eclipsed in a - worn disguise   <br/>
Did D# glow even though    <br/>
my G#m cries were driven by   <br/>
Tho E se echoed lies G#m No where to D# roam G#m   <br/>
Open my E eyes,  enli  G#m ghtened the child that   <br/>
Whispered  D# G#m   bardo   E  omnio G#m D#</p>

<p>G# F# B  D# F#   <br/>
G# F# C#m  D# C#   <br/>
G#m D#m B F#   <br/>
G#m D#m B A x3</p>

<p>Let me belong, eat me raw, suck me empty with   <br/>
Your hungry claws-bring me light   <br/>
Can you feel the tension burning?   <br/>
The soundtrack of our lives   <br/>
On an early April morning   <br/>
May be able to re-define</p>
