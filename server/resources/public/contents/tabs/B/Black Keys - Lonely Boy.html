<p>Well I’m so above you <br/>
And it’s plain to see <br/>
But I came to love you anyway <br/>
So you pulled my heart out <br/>
And I don’t mind bleeding <br/>
Any old time you keep me waiting <br/>
Waiting, waiting</p>

<p>Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting <br/>
Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting <br/>
I’m a lonely boy <br/>
I’m a lonely boy <br/>
Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting</p>

<p>Well your mama kept you but your daddy left you <br/>
And I should’ve done you just the same <br/>
But I came to love you <br/>
Am I born to bleed? <br/>
Any old time you keep me waiting <br/>
Waiting, waiting</p>

<p>Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting <br/>
Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting <br/>
I’m a lonely boy <br/>
I’m a lonely boy <br/>
Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting</p>

<p>Hey!</p>
