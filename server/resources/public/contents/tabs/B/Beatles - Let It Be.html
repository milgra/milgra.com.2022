<p>GD <br/>
When I find myself in times of trouble Em C <br/>
Mother Mary comes to me,  <br/>
 G                 D             C-Hm=Am G <br/>
speaking words of wisdom, let it be. <br/>

she is standing right in front of me, <br/>

And when the broken hearted people Em C <br/>

And when the night is cloudy  <br/>
Em           C <br/>
there is still a light that shines on me, <br/>

GD <br/>
I wake up to the sound of music  <br/>

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be. <br/>
