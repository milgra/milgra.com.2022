G#m These eyes, did I die behind these  
Cold blue eyes? Did I E know where to go?  
This G#m light, eclipsed in a - worn disguise  
Did D# glow even though   
my G#m cries were driven by  
Tho E se echoed lies G#m No where to D# roam G#m  
Open my E eyes,  enli  G#m ghtened the child that  
Whispered  D# G#m   bardo   E  omnio G#m D#

Let me belong, eat me raw, suck me empty with  
Your hungry claws-bring me light  
Can you feel the tension burning?  
The soundtrack of our lives  
On an early April morning  
May be able to re-define
