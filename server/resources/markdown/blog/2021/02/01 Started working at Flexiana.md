#Started working at Flexiana
_2021/02/01 clojure_

Clojure is a fantastic language and it's user base is growing in a healthy state, but there aren't much company yet that uses it exclusively. And there is Flexiana, a company that gathers clojure programmers and outsources them to projects and they are becoming the third biggest clojure programmer employers in the world. A friend of mine invited me to the company and after four rounds of interview I was there.

And I love it! It is a remote only company with great staff, I got outsourced to a german company with my friend, working in clojure with smart people is super.
