#i3-overview is ready!
_2021/12/04 C,linux_  

i3-overview is an application that shows thumbnails for all workspaces to make navigation in i3 easier.

Features

* no downscaled and confusing thumbnails, just crystal clear app names and titles
* layout schema makes workspace identification easier
* super lightweight, 0% cpu and memory usage when idle

Sometimes when I have to open an extreme amount of windows in i3 I really miss macos's expose function. So I decided to create someting similar but simple and minimalistic that fits i3's philospohy. It draws a schema based on i3-msg's get_tree output, it opens an X window and puts the image there.
