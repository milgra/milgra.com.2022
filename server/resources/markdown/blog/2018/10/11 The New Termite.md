#The New Termite
_Games_

Back in 2009 I released my first iOS game, Termite. There wasn't that many apps back then so it reached a wide audience and a lot of people loved it, they wrote heart-warming reviews. My favorite one was "Super game, it taught me a lot about teamwork!".

I just moved on to other games and project but I always wanted to update it somehow. Then after I completely fell in love with voxels it was clear : I have to create a 3D Termite based on voxels and with new things like walls but I also wanted to keep the mechanics and the levels of the original termite because it was somehow super playable.

So I started to work on it a year ago and despite my work and my other projects and other million distractions finally I finished it and I proudly release it for the raspberry for the first round. 

Check it out under the "Games" Tab. Enjoy!
