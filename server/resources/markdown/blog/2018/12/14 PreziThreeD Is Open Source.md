I was always curious why prezi didn't create a 3D version out of their app. It turned out that they experimented with it and dropped it in the end. So I created my own version and I really like how it looks like, how "rooms" can improve the mood of the presentation. But it complicates presentation creation big time for sure.

I've created a demo presentation about my life! :)
