#Sway-Overview is ready!
_2022/04/25 C,linux_  

Sway-Overview is an application that shows thumbnails for all workspaces to make navigation in sway easier.

Features

* no downscaled and confusing thumbnails, just crystal clear app names and titles
* layout schema makes workspace identification easier
* super lightweight, 0% cpu and memory usage when idle

Sometimes when I have to open an extreme amount of windows in sway I really miss macos's expose function. So I decided to create someting similar but simple and minimalistic that fits sway's philospohy. It draws a schema based on sway-msg's get_tree output, it puts it on a wayland layer and presents it.
