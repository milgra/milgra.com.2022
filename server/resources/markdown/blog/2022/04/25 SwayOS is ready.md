#SwayOS is ready!
_2022/04/25 C,linux_  

I think that sway is the future of linux desktop and I want to push it to everyone possible. So I've created a desktop configuration for sway that is suitable for beginners, user friendly, super elegant but still as minimal as possible.

It can be installed by installer scripts on existing OS'es or from a standalone ISO. The only supported OS currently is Arch Linux but hopefully I will get more and more setup script ports for other distributions and OS'es and I will also create some.
