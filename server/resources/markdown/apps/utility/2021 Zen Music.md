Zen Music is a music player, visualizer and organizer inspired by the 2000's era iTunes and the tracker music players of the early 90's.

Features

* retro-minimalistic UI
* beautiful and smooth UX experience
* always-on frequency and scope analyzer visualizers
* library auto-organization ( if enabled )
* activity window and human-readable database for transparent operation

I wrote a music player/visualizer/organizer on FreeBSD, for FreeBSD ( it compiles on Linux also ) because I really missed iTunes after switching to FreeBSD from MacOS and I also really missed the per-channel frequency analyzers of the late 80's/early 90's tracker music players. And because KDE/Qt/GTK couldn't deliver the smoothness/detail I wanted I wrote a separate UI renderer for it. It is still in beta but it's usable now, give it a try if you are into these kind of music players.
