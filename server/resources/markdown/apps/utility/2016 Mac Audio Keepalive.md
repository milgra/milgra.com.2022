Do you use an optical audio cable or HDMI to connect your mac and your amplifier? Do you experience one second silences in high fidelity music, lost words and lost sounds in movies? Well, it's not your nor your hardware's fault - it's an energy saving feature of these audio interfaces. And Audio Keepalive is the solution for you!!!

The app generates an absolutely unhearable tone that prevents your audio output to shut down at short silences/musical breaks, so you can enjoy an uninterrupted hi-fi audio stream.

Mac Audio Keepalive is a menu bar application. Just click on the menu bar icon and select "Quit" to quit.

Enjoy!

_I want it now!_

Reviews :

"Works as advertised and the tone is really un-hearable (tested it on my headphones and speakers at full volume)." 5/5, Poland
