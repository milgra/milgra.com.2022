#Milenia Grafter
_Java,Server_

Back in 2007, when I was still young and greedy I reverse-engineered the communication between the flash player and the very expensive flash media server and created my own version of an RTMP server. I wanted to show off like never before, so I decided that the size of the binary should stay under 64Kbytes, because we came from the eighties :) And I did it, it was never flawless or completely bug-free but it worked well. After other open-source and closed-source RTMP servers appeared, and new features were added to RTMP I couldn't keep up so I just dropped the project. Check it out.
