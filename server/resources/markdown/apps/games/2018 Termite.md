Termite is the ultimate psychedelic real-time action strategy experience.
You are the leader of a termite hive with three objectives :

- collect food
- produce ants
- destroy alien colonies

Select groups of termits, order them to collect food or attack aliens, use the speed slider to slow down/speed up time to have more control over your ants.

With Termite you get :

- 31 levels of intense action and mass destruction
- Random scene generator
- Tons of particles
- Voxel system based minimal design

[Termite is open-source, feel free to learn how to write muti-platform C games here](https://github.com/milgra/termite)
