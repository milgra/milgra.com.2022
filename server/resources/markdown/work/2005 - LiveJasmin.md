2005 - 2008 LiveJasmin

In 2005 I started working at LiveJasmin and became the lead developer of media streaming.

The stack was based on Flash, servers were Flash Media Servers.

We became the biggest adult streaming service in the world during my tech lead.

We used 80 percent of Hungary's international bandwidth.
