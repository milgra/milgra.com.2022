#2019 SteamBerry Co-Working Cafe

This year I opened the café of my dreams : it is half café, half co-working space, half geeky-nerdy community space with raspberry pi's, musical instruments, japanese kimono and live cat and puppy streams. 
I use raspberrys for everything : for cat/puppy streaming, for synthetizing sound for the MIDI keyboard, for playing music from youtube, for scratch for kids and for motion/face detection.
Motion/face detection is mainly for educational purposes : you can check out how it works on the upper level, and you can store your face/name if you want to save it for eternity! :)
