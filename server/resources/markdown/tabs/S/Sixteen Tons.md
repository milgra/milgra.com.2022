Am Am/GF E Some people say a man is made outa mud    
  Am         Am/G      F         E   
A poor man's made outa muscle 'n blood   
Am         Am/G      Dm   
Muscle an' blood an' skin an' bone   
  Am                     E   
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong   
Chorus    
         Am      Am/G     F          E   
You load sixteen tons an' what do ya get   
 Am         Am/G      F         E   
Another day older an' deeper in debt   
      Am              Am/G           Dm   
Saint Peter don't cha call me 'cause I can't go   
Am EAm   
I owe my soul to the company store    
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine   
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine   
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal   
And the strawboss said well bless my soul   
Chorus:    
I was born one morning in the drizzlin' rain   
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name   
I was raised in the canebreak by an' ol' mama lion   
Ain't no high-tone woman make me walk the line   
Chorus:    
If ya see me comin' better step aside   
A lotta men din't an' a lotta men died   
With one fist of iron an' the other of steel   
If the right one don' getcha then the left one will   
Chorus:
