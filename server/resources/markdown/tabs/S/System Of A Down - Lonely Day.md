Such a lonely day, and it's mine   
The most loneliest day of my life    
such a lonely day, should be banned   
It's a day that I can't stand    
    
The most loneliest day of my life    
the most loneliest day of my life    
    
such a lonely day, shouldn't exist    
it's a day that I'll never miss    
such a lonely day, and it's mine   
the most loneliest day of my life    
    
E          D#7 F#       Gm#   
and if you go, I wanna go with you    
and if you die, I wanna die with you    
E                                   D#7   
take your hand and walk away

Such a lonely day, and it's mine    
It's a day that I'm glad I survived
