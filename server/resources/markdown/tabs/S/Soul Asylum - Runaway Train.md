Intro: C 
C 
          Call you up in the middle of the night
Em/B 
          Like a firefly without a light
Am 
          You were there like a blowtorch burnin'
G 
          I was a key that could use a little turnin'
C 
          So tired that I couldn't even sleep
Em 
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Am 
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
G 
One more promise I couldn't keep
FG 
It seems no one can help me now
C Am 
I'm in too deep there's no way out
F Em G 
This time I have really led myself astray
Chorus: 
C 
Runaway train never going back
Em 
Wrong way on a one way track
Am 
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
G 
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
Verse 2: 
C 
Can you help me remember how to smile
Em 
Make it somehow all seem worthwile
Am 
How on earth did I get so jaded
G 
Life's mysteries seem so faded
C 
I can go where no one else can go
Em 
I know what no one else knows
Am 
Here I am just drowning in the rain
G 
With a ticket for a runaway train
FG 
And everything seems cut and dry
C Am 
Day and night, Earth and sky
FEm G 
Somehow I just don't believe it
Chorus: 
C 
Repeat 
Runaway train never going back
Em 
Wrong way on a one way track
Am 
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
G 
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
Bridge: 
C 
Got a ticket for a runaway train
Em 
Like a madman laughing at the rain
Am 
Little out of touch little insane
G 
It's just easier than dealing with the pain
C 
Runaway train never going back
Em 
Wrong way on a one way track
Am 
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
G 
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
C 
Runaway train never coming back
Em 
Runaway train tearing up the track
Am 
Runaway train burning in my veins
G 
Id runaway but it always seems the same.
C-Em-Am-G  and fade
