basszus + felso 3 hur valtva pengetes   
   
Bm I can't go home   
A  I cannot sleep   
Bm I cannot give   
A  I cannot keep   
G  This heart of stone has left me here   
With only F#m rumors of your left   
G  I guess to see you leaving was for F#m the best A   
Bm I dream too much   
A  and spend my days   
Bm  Like a sailor G lost at  A sea   
G  And you were like a mermaid   
in that Fm Danish fairytale   
G  I guess the best thing that I could do is to F#m sail A   
Bm Away from this G sunken soldiers ball   
BbmAway, do you G remember me at all?   
Fm I have no better words than G "Thank you and goodbye"   
Fm I wish I didn't have to see our G love A die Bm   
   
La La La La La   
   
Bm At last I'm home   
A  My horse will rest   
Bm This tattoed heart   
A  This trembling chest   
G  must be alone   
And carry this sorrow Fm back to bed   
G  I hope there was no innocent blood F#m shed A   
Bm Away from this G sunken soldiers ball   
Bm Away, do you G remember me at all?   
Fm I have no better words than G "Thank you and goodbye"   
Fm I wish I didn't have to see our G love A die Bm   
   
La La La La
