Be my guard just for tonight, 
That is all I m asking for 
Take me under your wing, 
I can't make it anymore 
I am so full of fear, 
May you read a book to me 
And when the shadows grow 
Won t you stay with me 

Will you be my guard tonight? 
That is all I m asking for 
Will you be my guard tonight? 
That is all I need to know 

Be my guard beside my bed, 
That is all I need to know 
Will you please hold my hand, 
Don't you ever let it go 
All the wonders of the world 
For a little second more 
I can't speak but can't you see, 
It's your touch I'm crying for 

Will you be my guard tonight? 
That is all I m asking for 
Will you be my guard tonight? 
That is all I need to know 

Be my guard just until dawn, 
When I can hear the birds again 
I'm as helpless as can be, 
Will you guard my little flame 
If we never meet again, 
You shall always keep in mind 
That you were my guard tonight, 
That you were my guard tonight 

Will you be my guard tonight? 
That is all I m asking for 
Will you be my guard tonight? 
That is all I need to know
