In a cavern, in a canyon,
    Hm7           D7
Excavating for a mine,
CG Dwelt a miner, forty-niner 
         Am   -=  D7    G
And his daughter Clementine.
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine!
You are lost and gone for ever,
Dreadful sorry, Clementine.
Light she was and like a fairy,
And her shoes were number nine,
Herring boxes without topses,
Sandals were for Clementine.
Oh, my darling...
Drove she ducklings to the water
Every morning, just at nine;
Hit her foot against a splinter,
Fell into the foaming brine.
Oh, my darling...
Saw her lips above the water
Blowing bubbles mighty fine
But alas! I was no swimmer,
So I lost my Clementine.
Oh, my darling...
In a dream she still does hunt me
Robed in garments, soaked in brine;
Tough in life I used to hug her,
Now she's dead I'll draw the line.
Oh, my darling...
How I missed her, how I missed her,
How I missed my Clementine!
But I kissed her little sister
And forgot my Clementine.
Oh, my darling...
