[Female]   
    
Am                             G   
 Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring.   
Am                         G   
 My summer wine is really made from all these things.   
    
    
[Male]   
    
Am                          G   
 I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled too.   
Am                      G   
 A song that I had only sang to just a few.   
Dm                           Am   
 She saw my silver spurs and said let's pass some time.   
Dm                      Am   
 And I will give to you summer wine.   
Dm    G        Am   
Ohhh-oh summer wine.

[Male]   
    
Am                         G   
 My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak.   
Am                       G   
 I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet.   
Dm                        Am   
 She reassured me with an unfamiliar line.   
Dm                      Am   
 And then she gave to me more summer wine.   
Dm    G        Am   
Ohhh-oh summer wine.

 When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes.   
Am                             G   
 My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size.   
Dm                           Am   
 She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime.   
Dm                      Am   
 And left me cravin' for more summer wine.   
Dm    G        Am
