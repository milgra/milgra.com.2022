Em No one knows what it's G like, to be the D bad man     
To be the C sad man, A behind blue eyes     
Em No one knows what it's G like to be D hated     
To be C fated, to telling A only lies     
    
But my C dreams, D they aren't as G empty     
As my C conscience D seems to E be     
I have Bm7 hours, only C lonely     
My love is D vengeance that's never A free     
   
Em No one knows what it's G like to feel these D feelings     
C Like I do, and I A blame you     
Em No one bites back as G hard on their D anger     
C None of my pain and woe, A can show through     
   
C But my dreams, D they aren't as G empty     
C As my conscience D seems to E be     
I have Bm7 hours, C only lonely     
D My love is vengeance A that's never free     
   
Em No one knows what its G like     
D To be mistreated, C to be defeated     
A Behind blue eyes     
Em No one knows how to G say     
D That they're sorry and C don't worry     
A I'm not telling lies     
   
C But my dreams, D they aren't as G empty     
C As my conscience D seems to E be     
Dm I have hours, C only lonely     
D My love is vengeance A that's never free     
   
Em No one knows what it's G like, to be the D bad man     
C To be the sad man, A behind blue eyes
