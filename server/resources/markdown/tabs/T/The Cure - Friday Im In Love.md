To see your shoes and your spirits rise   
Bmin              G    
Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound   
D                 A    
And as sleek as a shriek spinning round and round   
Bmin              G   
Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight   
D          A   
To see you eat in the middle of the night   
Bmin              G   
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
