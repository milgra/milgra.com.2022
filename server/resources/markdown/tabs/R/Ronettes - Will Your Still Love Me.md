[Intro:]  C  F  G7
 
[Verse 1]
C                      F         G7
Tonight you're mine completely,
C                     G
You give your love so sweetly,
  E         E7       Am
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes,
F            G7        C
But will you love me tomorrow?
 
[Verse 2]
C                 F          G7
Is this a lasting treasure,
C                  G
Or just a moment's pleasure,
    E   E7         Am
Can I believe the magic of your sighs,
F              G7        C
Will you still love me tomorrow?
 
[Bridge]
F                    Em
Tonight with words unspoken,
F             G7           C
You said that I'm the only one,
F                    Em
But will my heart be broken,
         Am
When the night (When the night)
          D7      F      G7 (hold strings pause) Base run: G  A  C  C  D
Meets the morning sun.
 
[Verse 3]
C                     F          G7
I'd like to know that your love,
C                G        (hold strings pause) Base run: G  F# F
Is love I can be sure of,                                      So
E       E7       Am
Tell me now and I won't ask again,
F              G7        C
Will you still love me tomorrow?
F              G7        C
Will you still love me tomorrow?
