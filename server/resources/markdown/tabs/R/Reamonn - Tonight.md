INTRO:EmAmDBm CAmDB    
EmAm D    
She never took the train alone   
Bm C    
she hated being on her own   
Am D    
She always took me by the hands   
B    
and say she needs me   
She never wanted love to fail   
she always hoped that it was real   
She'd look me in the eyes and say believe me   
And then the night becomes the day   
and there’s nothing left to say   
If there's nothing left to say   
then something’s wrong   
EmAm D Bm    
Ohhh tonight you killed me with your smile   
C Am B    
so beautiful and wild so beautiful   
EmAmD Bm    
Oh tonight you killed me with your smile   
C Am B Em    
so beautiful and wild so beautiful and wild   
And as the hands would turn with time   
she'd always say that she was my mine   
She'd turn and lend a smile   
to say that she's gone   
But in a whisper she'd arrive   
and dance into my life   
Like a music melody   
like a lovers song   
Oh tonight you killed me with your smile   
so beautiful and wild so beautiful   
Oh tonight you killed me with your smile   
so beautiful and wild so beautiful and wild   
B Em    
Through the darkest night   
B Em    
comes the brightest light   
B Em    
And the light that shines   
Em    
is deep inside   
B    
It's who you are   
EmAm D Bm    
Ohhh tonight you killed me with your smile   
C Am B    
so beautiful and wild so beautiful   
EmAmD Bm    
Oh tonight you killed me with your smile   
C Am B Em    
so beautiful and wild so beautiful and wild   
CAmD C    
Oh tonight.. you killed me with your smile   
Am DB Em    
so beautiful and wild so beautiful and wild ...
