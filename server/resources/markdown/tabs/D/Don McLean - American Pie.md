Helter skelter in the summer swelter_ the birds flew off with a fallout shelter

The players tried for a forward pass with the jester on the sidelines in a cast_

I asked her for some happy news but she just smiled__ and turned away.   
.GDEm AmC   
I went down to the sacred store. Where I heard the music years before.__

But the man there said the music wouldn't play.__ And    
'Cause fire is the devil's

But not a word was spoken.__ The church__ bells_ all_ were_ broken.   
.GDEm Am7 D And the three men I admire most: the father, Son and the Holy Ghost__
