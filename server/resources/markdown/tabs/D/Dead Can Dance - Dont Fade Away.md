Don't fade away..
        Am   Amsus4   Am   Amsus4   Am
My brown-eyed girl
C EmCadd9Em Come Walk with me.. 
                        Am   Amsus4   Am   Amsus4   Am
I'll fill your heart with joy
G BmEm And we'll dance through our isolation 
G Bm Em
Seeking solace in the wisdom we bestow
G Bm Em
Turning thoughts to the here and ever after G Bm Em
Consuming fears in our fiery halos 
C Em Cadd9 Em Say what you mean.. 
              Am   Amsus4   Am   Amsus4   Am
Mean what you  say
C Em Cadd9 Em I've heard that innocence 
                   Am   Amsus4   Am   Amsus4   Am
Has led us all astray
G Bm Em
But don't let them make you and break you
G Bm Em
The world is filled with their broken empty dreams G Bm Em
Silence is their only virtue
G Bm Em
Locked away inside their silent screams 
        E
But for now...

Let us dance away this starry night
A                    Asus4   Dmaj7   D
Filled with the glow of the fiery stars
          Em   Emsus4       Bm    Bm7
And with the dawn our sun will rise
Em                           Emsus4   Bm    Bm7
Bringing a symphony of birthright
