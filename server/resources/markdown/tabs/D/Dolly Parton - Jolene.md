Am Jolene, C Jolene, G Jolene, Jo Am lene   
I`m G  begging of you please dont take my Am man   
Am Jolene, C Jolene, G Jolene, Jo Am lene   
G Please don`t take him just because you Am can   
   
Your Am beauty is C beyond compare   
With G flaming locks of Am auburn hair   
With G ivory skin and eyes of emerald Am green   
Your Am smile is like a C breath of spring   
Your G voice is soft like Am summer rain   
And I G cannot compete with you, Am Jolene   
   
He Am talks about you C in his sleep   
Theres G nothing I can do Am to keep   
From G crying when he calls your name, Am Jolene   
And Am I can easily  C understand    
How G you could easily Am take my man   
But G you don`t know what he means to me, Am Jolene   
   
Chorus   
   
Am You could have your C choice of men   
But G I could never Am love again   
He`s the G only one for me, Am Jolene   
I Am had to have this C talk with you    
My G happiness de Am pends on you   
And G whatever you decide to do, Am Jolene   
   
Chorus
