[Verse]   
Bm   
   If you're leaving, close the door.   
A                         Bm   
  I'm not expecting people   anymore.   
Bm   
   Hear me grieving, lying on the floor.   
A/C#                           Bm   
     Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.   
   
[Chorus]   
Bm                D   
   I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man.   
G              Em   
  And my world is pale.   
Bm   
   When a blind man cries,   
D          G       G/F#  Em   Em/D   Bm   
  Lord you know there ain't a sadder tale.

[Verse]   
   
Bm   
   Had a friend once, in a room.   
A                         Bm   
  Had a good time, but it ended much too soon.   
Bm   
   In a cold month, in that room.   
A                        Bm   
  Found a reason for the things we had to do.   
   
   
[Chorus]   
   
Bm            D   
   I'm a blind, I'm a blind man.   
G               Em   
  Now my room is cold.   
Bm   
   When a blind man cries,   
D              G   G/F# Em Em/D   Bm   
  Lord you know he feels  it from his soul
