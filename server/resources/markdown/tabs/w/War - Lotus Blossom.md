Solo in A  
Oh oh  
F#m G#m C  
Oh oh  
F#m G#m C  

A G#m C#m  
I've been searching most everywhere  
A G#m C#m  
To find someone with whom I could compare  
A G#m C#m  
And now I've found her she's right there  
A G#m C#m  
You know you know  
A G#m C#m  
Desert honey Lotus Blossom  
A G#m C#m  
Hungry man has always got some time  
A G#m C#m  
To take away from you  
Bm A E  
Gentle hearts we've known too few  
A G#m C#m  
Fallin in love coolin out  
A G#m C#m  
Peace of mind must come about  
A G#m C#m  
So rest your racing aching brain  
Bm A E  
Stone blind mirror looks insane  
A G#m C#m  
Almost coming almost gone  
A G#m C#m  
Always caught inside a song  
A G#m C#m ( B A ? )  
So stop and sip my cactus syrup  
A G#m C#m ( B A ? )  
'Fore you climb into the stirrup  
A G#m C#m A G#m C#m  
And ride, in stride, survive in time  
F#m Bm   
Empty arms forever running  
C#m D E  
Sunny lady left too long  
A F#m   
Desert honey almost coming  
A B F#m  
Lotus Blossom almost gone  
A G#m C#m  
You know ooohhhhh  
A G#m C#m B C#m  
You know ooohhhhh  

A G#m C#m
