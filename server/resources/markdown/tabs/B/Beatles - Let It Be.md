When I find myself in times of trouble Em C
Mother Mary comes to me, 
 G                 D             C-Hm=Am G
speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

And in my hour of darkness 
        Em                C
she is standing right in front of me,

speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people Em C
