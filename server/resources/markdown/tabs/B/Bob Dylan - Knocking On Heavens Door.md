Mama take this badge off of me  
I can't use it any-more  
It's getting dark, too dark to see  
I feel I'm knockin on heaven's door  
 
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  

Mama put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot them any-more  
That long black cloud is comin' down  
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
 
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
 
Oo - oo - oo - oo
