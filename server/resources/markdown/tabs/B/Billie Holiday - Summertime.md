Summertime and the living is easy   
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high   
Your daddy's rich and your mama's good looking   
So hush now little baby don't you cry   
   
One of these mornings you're going to rise up singing   
Then you'll spread your wings and you'll take the sky   
But until that morning there's a-nothing can harm you   
With Daddy and Mammy standing byï»¿
