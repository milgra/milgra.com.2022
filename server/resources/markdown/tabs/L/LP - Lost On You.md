Am  When you get older, plainer, saner 
D Em 
Will you remember all the danger we came from 
Am  Burning like embers, falling, tender 
D Longing for the days of no surrender 
Em Years ago 
Em And well you know 

Am Smoke 'em if you got them 
D 'Cause it's going down 
Em Em7 
All I ever wanted was you 
Am I'll never get to heaven 
D 'Cause I don't know how 
Em Let's raise a glass or two 

Em Am 
To all the things I lost on you 
D Oh oh 
Em Tell me are they lost on you? 
C Oh oh 
Am Just that you could cut me loose 
D Oh oh 
Em After everything I've lost on you 
C Is that lost on you? 
Am D 
Oooooh oooh 
Em Oooooh 
C Is that lost on you? 
Am D 
Oooooh oooh 
Em Baby is that lost on you? 
C Is that lost on you? 

Am Wishing I could see the machinations 
D Em 
Understand the toil of expectations in your mind 
Am Hold me like you never lost your patience 
D Em 
Tell me that you love me more than hate me all the time 
Em And you're still mine

Am So smoke 'em if you've got 'em 
D 'Cause it's going down 
Em All I ever wanted was you 
C Let's take a drink of heaven 
D This can turn around 
Em Let's raise a glass or two 

Am To all the things I've lost on you 
D Oh oh 
Em Tell me are they lost on you? 
C Oh oh 
Am Just that you could cut me loose 
D Oh oh 
Em After everything I've lost on you 
C Is that lost on you?
