A E Bm    
I want to hold the hand inside you   
AE Bm    
I want to take a breath that's true   
A E Bm    
I look to you and I see nothing   
A E Bm    
I look to you to see the truth   
A E Bm    
You live your life You go in shadows   
AE Bm    
You'll come apart and you'll go black   
AE Bm    
Some kind of night into your darkness   
AE Bm    
Colors your eyes with what's not there.   
CHORUS   
AE Bm    
Fade into you    
A E Bm    
Strange you never knew   
AE Bm D    
Fade into you    
A E Bm    
I think it's strange you never knew   
A E Bm    
A stranger's light comes on slowly   
A stranger's heart without a home   
You put your hands into your head   
And then smiles cover your heart   
CHORUS   
(Repeat 2x)   
Fade into you   
Strange you never knew   
Fade into you   
I think it's strange you never knew   
I think it's strange you never knew (Repeat 2x)
