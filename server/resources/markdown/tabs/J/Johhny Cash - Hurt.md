I hurt myself today to see if I still feel     
I focus on the pain the only thing that's real     
The needle tears a hole the old familiar sting     
Try to kill it all away but I remember G everything     
    
Am What have I F become?  C  My sweetest G friend     
Am Everyone I F know  goes C away in the G end     
Am And you could have it F all  G  My empire of G dirt     
Am I will let you F down  G  I will make you Am hurt     
    
(Am)   C  D  Am    C  D     
    
I wear this crown of thorns   upon my liar's chair     
Full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair     
Beneath the stains of time   the feelings disappear     
You are someone else   I am still right here     
   
Am What have I F become?  C  My sweetest G friend     
Am Everyone I F know  goes C away in the G end     
Am And you could have it F all  G  My empire of G dirt     
Am I will let you F down  G  I will make you Am hurt     
Am If I could start F again  G a million miles G away     
Am I would keep F myself  G I would find a way
