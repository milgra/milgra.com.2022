The shrill streaks of morning ignite some closing loss
Am D Am7 D Bm Em
And the silence speaks more human weight Than you've ever known;

For words are like weapons That only will disclose

your weakness. But all that was breaking, All that was stone,

Em C D
Are as far beyond you as the stars;
Em C D 
As far beyond them as you are.

Pouring unfamiliar pain

In black sheets of separation -
